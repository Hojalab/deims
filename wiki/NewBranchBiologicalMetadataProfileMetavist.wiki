#New Branch as of April 2011

==Why a new Branch==

The National Biological Information Infrastructure, a program of the USGS is supporting further development of this tool.  However, the gov. folks would like to see a complete mapping between the information placeholders proposed in the Biological Data Profile (BDP).  The BDP is a profile of the Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (CSDGM) that implements in XML a mean to create Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGCD) compliant spatial metadata.  

==Status==

Currently, this branch is in active development, and a beta version of the package should be complete by May 2011.

You should find features, modules, content types that meet the requirements expressed above. If you want to see the BDP standard you can find it easily googling it.
