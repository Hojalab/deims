=The road ahead, proposed enhancements=

==What we propose to make better==

  Here is a small list of changes we propose to make the DEIMS experience more rewarding
===Usability===
  * Add _Conditional Fields_ -- simplify form for easy navigation
  * Add code-code definition CCK module -- break that field in pairs.
  * Modal Editor integration - add pop-ups that enable editing without leaving the page
  * Improve documentation
  * Improve packaging

===Back end changes, improvements===
  * From _geo_ to _openlayers_ an enhancement via public API
  * Move node-reference from parent content type to child content type
  * Integrate Unit Dictionary - either REST service or measure contrib module
  * Feeds integration, towards consuming actual data and EML
  * _Scratchpads_ species list (taxonomic coverage and pages)
